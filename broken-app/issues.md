-import the axios library at the beginning of the file.

-use the express.json() middleware to parse the JSON request body.

-check if the developers field exists in the request body and if it's an array. If not, we return a 400 Bad Request response.

-use Promise.all to make concurrent requests to the GitHub API for each developer and await the results.

-catch errors that may occur during the requests and return a 500 Internal Server Error response with an error message.

-explicitly specify the content type as JSON when sending responses.
